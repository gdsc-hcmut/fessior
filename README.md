## Technology

### Routing

To custom the route, open file [app.module](./src/app.module.ts) and looking for **RouteModule** to add your route.

### Versioning

URI Versioning uses the version passed within the URI of the request, such as `https://example/v1/route` and `https://example/v1/route`

- In this repo, the default version is `v1`.
- We can set version for all routes within the controller which will override the default. See sample [here](./src/templates/templates.controller.ts)
- Also, we can set version for an individual route which will override other version. See sample [here](./src/templates/templates.controller.ts)

### Environment

To use an environment variable, we declare it within file [global.d](./typings/global.d.ts)

### Swagger

The OpenAPI specification is a language-agnostic definition format used to describe RESTful APIs.

While the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`. You should see the Swagger UI.
